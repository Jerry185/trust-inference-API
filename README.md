# trust-inference-API
An opensource API exposing multiple algorithms for infering trust in a network

## Instructions
For each of these algorithms, the input data format should be a file, with each line representing an edge from A -> B, i.e. "A B". If the graph is weighted then the line should be of the format "A B W" where W represents the weight of the trust, which should be normalised, i.e. between 0 and 1.
